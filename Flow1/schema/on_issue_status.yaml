                        display is set to false, then the group will not be
                        displayed. If it is set to true, it should be displayed.
                        However, group-level display properties can be overriden
                        by individual tag-level display property. As this schema
                        is purely for catalog display purposes, it is not
                        recommended to send this value during search.

                        property can be set by BAPs during search to narrow the
                        `search` and achieve more relevant results. When
                        received during `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                        under the heading described by the `name` property of
                        this schema.

                          Describes a tag. This is used to contain extended
                          metadata. This object can be added as a property to
                          any schema to describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                          tags can be sent during search to optimize and filter
                          search results. BPPs can use tags to index their
                          catalog to allow better search functionality. Tags are
                          sent by the BPP as part of the catalog response in the
                          `on_search` callback. Tags are also meant for display
                          purposes. Upon receiving a tag, BAPs are meant to
                          render them as name-value pairs. This is particularly
                          useful when rendering tabular information about a
                          product or service.
